\section{Simple BP and Binary Representation}
Set up your network in a 2-input, 4-hidden and 1-output configuration. Apply the XOR training set. Initialize weights to random values in the range -0.5 to +0.5 and set the learning rate to 0.2 with momentum at 0.0.

Define your XOR problem using a binary representation. Draw a graph of total error against number of epochs. On average, how many epochs does it take to reach a total error of less than 0.05? You should perform many trials to get your results, although you donâ€™t need to plot them all.

\begin{center}

\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
        xlabel=a) epochs,
        width=\textwidth,
        ylabel=MSE,
        xticklabel style={rotate=15},          
]
    \addplot[smooth,mark=.,blue] table {a.tex};
    \addlegendentry{Momentum = 0, Binary}
    \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}

\end{center}

Out of \textbf{300} trials, on average it took \textbf{\input{a_avg.tex}} epochs for the simple backpropagation algorithm to achieve the error of less than 0.05. 

Please note that through this report the backpropagation is done layer by layer from the last layer, i.e. first the last layer parameters are updated, then a new error signal is calculated for the hidden layer. 

\section{Bipolar representation}
This time use a bipolar representation. Again, graph your results to show the total error varying against number of epochs. On average, how many epochs to reach a total error of less than 0.05?


\begin{center}

\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
        xlabel=b) epochs,
        width=\textwidth,
        ylabel=MSE]
    \addplot[smooth,mark=.,blue] table {b.tex};
    \addlegendentry{Momentum = 0, Bipolar}
    \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}

\end{center}

Out of \textbf{300} trials, on average it took \textbf{\input{b_avg.tex}} epochs for the simple backpropagation algorithm to achieve the error of less than 0.05. 

\section{Adding momentum}
Now set the momentum to 0.9. What does the graph look like now and how fast can 0.05 be reached?


\begin{center}

\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
        xlabel=c) epochs,
        width=\textwidth,
        ylabel=MSE]
    \addplot[smooth,mark=x,blue] table {c.tex};
    \addlegendentry{Momentum = 0.9, Bipolar}
    \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}

\end{center}

Out of \textbf{300} trials, on average it took \textbf{\input{c_avg.tex}} epochs for the simple backpropagation algorithm to achieve the error of less than 0.05.
